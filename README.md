# Wazuh_Docker-X-Graylog-Docker
Integration with wazuh x graylog using docker-compose

Repository dedicated to those who want to use Wazuh-multi-node in docker mode and connected to integration with Graylog also in docker mode.

I left only graylog's docker compose, because wazuh's docker is the default that comes with the multi-node and it doesn't influence anything in the integration with graylog.
